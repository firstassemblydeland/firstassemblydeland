Michael Modica has been Lead Pastor at First Assembly DeLand since September 1992. Michael along with Renee his wife of 35 years oversee First Assembly DeLand.

After time in the U.S. ARMY and then college, Michael spent time in the corporate world content to serve and finance ministries locally and around the world. Pastor Modica thought it would be wise to start his theological studies in case there would be a call into ordained ministry years later. This calling came after serving at their local church faithfully in the New Jersey. God called them nearly 1000 miles south over 30 years ago and they have never looked back.

Some 20 years ago Michael & Renee were invited to do a church rebirth and revitalization in First Assembly Deland. The rest is a history in progress as a great small group caught the vision. Five building programs later, First Assembly remains faithful to the Gospel. Christ has been glorified throughout all this work.

Pastor Modica actively works with other pastors in the area. His desire is to promote a unified evangelism and strategic prayer outreaches and leading joint efforts on various events such as Community Wide Prayer Services and city reaching venues.

Michael also serves as a Chaplain for the DeLand Police Dept. and Florida Hospital group.

In the past he served on the Board of Directors & Advisors for Teen Challenge, YMCA, Billion Soul, Synergies Ministry. Resident Instructor for DISOM â€“ Global University and Billion Soul Minister International Training Center.
