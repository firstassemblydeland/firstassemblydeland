Sam Neal joins the First Assembly staff as the Generations pastor.  He is a graduate of Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God with a Pastoral Ministries Leadership degree. Before he graduated he met the love of his life, Allison.  They have been married for 20 years with 4 amazing sons, Jaxon, Liam, Deacon, and Cooper.

Sam loves a good laugh, a great movie and football, especially Notre Dame.  Allison is a tremendous support to him.  She is a 1st grade teacher and loves a good cup of coffee.  Their boys love to play sports, go fishing, movies and of course video games.

Sam has served as a Youth Pastor for over 20 years, in South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.   He has participated and led numerous missions trips and camps.  He loves to mentor and train up young leaders. He created a student ministry leadership idea called the Intiative.  

His heart and philosophy is to make everyone feel as though they belong and are loved.  He believes that if you build a community of believers you can then go out and reach the community for Jesus.

His family is very grateful to be back in Florida, the land of Publix and football.
