**The Gift of God is Eternal Life through Jesus Christ**

Two great moments in our lives are when we were born and when we discover why we were born. We were created for a reason-a divine purpose. Our lives are not accidents or just fate.

God loves you and wants to have a close, loving relationship with you here on earth and wants you to spend Eternity with Him in Heaven. Eternal Life is a free gift from God, but we must choose to accept it.

God created us with a free will and we often choose to disobey Him. This part of our nature is called sin and it separates us from God. The Bible says: “for all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.” Romans 3:23

God is perfect and cannot allow sin in His Presence. Unless we are cleansed of our sin, the price we will pay when we die will be eternal separation in hell away from God. “For the wages of sin is death.” Romans 6:23a

The penalty for sin is death, but 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ, the Holy Son of God, became a man and for 33 years He lived without sin. He paid for all of our sins by His death on the Cross. After 3 days, He came back to life and rose from the dead.

God sent His Son Jesus Christ to pay the price of our sin for us.

“But God demonstrates His Own Love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”Romans 5:8

We are not saved from sin by our own efforts. Our best is not good enough to make up for our sin. Jesus took all of our sin upon Himself and paid the debt of sin that was upon us by His death on the Cross.

“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith–and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God–not by works, so that no one can boast.” Ephesians 2:8-9

“…if you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Romans 10:9

Jesus paid for our sins and made it possible for us to come to Him and receive His gift of Eternal Life. Always know that if we were worth dying for, Jesus is worth living for.

If you would like to pray to receive Christ, put your trust in Him, and receive His gift of Eternal Life, pray this prayer: Lord Jesus, I need you. Please forgive me for the sins I have done. Thank you for dying on the Cross for my sins. Come into my life as my Savior and Lord. I want to obey and live for you now. Thank you for forgiving my sins and giving me Eternal Life.

To begin to know someone you have to spend time with them. Begin to read the Bible – start with the Gospel of John and start talking to God. He is now with you and wants to spend time with you. Get to know Him. He’s waited a long time for this moment.
