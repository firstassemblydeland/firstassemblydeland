## 1. JESUS
We are most committed to the preaching of Jesus. Our message is everything. We are Jesus people, not religious people. Methods will come and go, yet our message will remain the same.

## 2. PEOPLE
Our heart is for ALL people. All people are loved by Jesus. We make no apologies for being specifically focused on reaching the lost. We desire to bring the broken home at all costs. We believe that our light is best seen in the night.

## 3. GENEROSITY
Generosity is more than giving, it is a lifestyle. Generosity is our pleasure. For God so loved, that He gave. Our generosity is the joyous overflow of love from our forgiven souls. Our lives our models of contagious generosity to all. With freedom and delight we give our time, talent and treasures to the God who gave everything for us.

## 4. EXCELLENCE
We are always going to do the best with what we have. We are on time, engaged and prepared. We do not do things half way. If we are going to do it, we are going to do it to the best of our ability.

## 5. SERVANTHOOD
Our lives are aimed at helping others, not using them. We want to help whenever possible. We strive to live as those who bring attention to Jesus through how we serve, and not only by what we say.

## 6. HONOR
We honor others by accepting who God says they are and viewing them according to their God-given identities.  We choose to courageously treat all people according to their eternal identities as free, valuable and powerful children of God.  Honor is given, it is never demanded. As we faithfully  honor who God says people are, it positions us to receive the gift of who they are in our lives and communities.

## 7. PASSION
Everything we do, we do it with passion. From our worship to our service, we do it with Holy Ghost energy. Passion drives us. Passion for Jesus. Passion for people. Passion for His church.
